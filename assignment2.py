# Create a folder with your name in the root of this project
# Create a new file within this folder and name it assignment2.js
# Answer the follwoing questions:

# Q1: 
# Declare a variable called "str" and assign it a string
#  value. Use the toLowerCase() method to convert "str"
#  to lowercase, then use the split() method to create
#  a list of characters from "str" and use the reverse()
#  method to reverse the order of the characters in 
# the list. Finally, join the characters in the list 
# back together into a string and store the result in 
# a new variable called "reverseStr". Compare "str" 
# to "reverseStr" using conditional statement and output 
# "The string is a palindrome" if they are the same or 
# "The string is not a palindrome" if they are different.

# Q2:
# Declare a list called "numbers" and initialize
#  it with a list of integers. Use the list index 
# to access each element and multiply it by 2. 
# Output the modified list.

# Q3:
# Declare a dictionary called "person" with properties "name",
#  "age" and "gender". Use a conditional statement to 
# check if the age property is greater than 30, then 
# output the key-value pairs of the dictionary using the 
# dictionary properties.
