# Class Exercise

# Q1:
# Write a program that simulates a website
# Users should be allowed to register
# They should then be allowed to login
# With their email and password
# If their email is correct and their password
# is also correct, the website should welcome
# them by their names.
# If their email is correct and their password
# is not, notify them that their password is 
# wrong. If thier email is wrong but their 
# password is correct notify them that their 
# email is wrong. If neither are correct
# tell them their credentials are invalid
