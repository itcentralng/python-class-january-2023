Python datatypes

- integers; +- whole numbers e.g -1,2,70,etc

- floats; decimal numbers e.g 2.99,1.0,13.7,etc

- strings; any character in '' or "" e.g 'Aisha','H',"60"," ",etc

- boolean; represents one of two values either "True" or "False"

- list; any data type in [] seperated by "," e.g [],[1,2,3,4,5],['aminu',{'name':'jamilu', 'age':30},45],etc

- tuple; similar to a list just functionally different and collect data types in "()"

- dictionary: has a key and it's respective value in a "{}" seperated by "," e.g {1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'},
{'a':10,'b':12,'c':14,'d':16,'e':18,'f':20},{'fruit':'apple','carb':'rice','veg':'cabbage'}.



variable naming convention in python and create examples of each

-A variable should start with a letter or an underscore. Examples are; num1, _shoppinglist, Age, name and so on.

-A variable name cannot start with a number. Examples are 1num, 90days, 7courses, 25thjanuary.

-A variable can only contan alpha-numeric characters and underscore. Examples are; subject1, _profile_, section7, no1_series.

-A variable can only be name cannot be a reserved name in python. Examples are; Type, print, class, and so on.

-Variables are case sensitive so Age is different from age.

-Variable cannot have whitespace in between them. Examples are; num 1, january 21st, first class, and so on
